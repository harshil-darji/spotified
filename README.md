## Spotify clone using React

Spotified uses the Spotify api. To use the app, create a ```.env``` file and put in the server folder. It has to include 3 parameters:

1.  REDIRECT_URI
2.  CLIENT_ID
3.  CLIENT_SECRET

Later, use ```npm start``` in both the client and server folders to bootstrap the website.
