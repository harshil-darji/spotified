## Spotify clone using React

Spotified uses the Spotify api. To use the app, create a ```.env``` file and put it in both, server and client folders. It has to include 3 parameters:

1.  REACT_REDIRECT_URI
2.  REACT_CLIENT_ID
3.  REACT_CLIENT_SECRET

Later, use ```npm start``` in both the client and server folders to bootstrap the website.
